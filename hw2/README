This is my submission for HW2. It is organized as follows:
* lib/      contains the jar needed to compile with Hadoop
* dist/     contains the compiled jar of the project
* build/    contains the compiled classes
* src/      contains the sourcecode for all the files.

The jobs for the various parts of the homework are as follows:
edu.kent.cs.ntietz.PairsJob
edu.kent.cs.ntietz.StripesJob
These then take commandline arguments to set them up for the different parts of the assignment.
