This README will explain how my project is laid out and how to run each part of the submission.
Attached in the pics/ directory are the screenshots of the running jobs.

PROJECT SETUP

This is my submission for HW2. It is organized as follows:
* lib/      contains the jar needed to compile with Hadoop
* dist/     contains the compiled jar of the project
* build/    contains the compiled classes
* src/      contains the sourcecode for all the files
* pics/     contains the screenshots of the running jobs
* build.xml is the buildfile for the project

The jobs for the various parts of the homework are as follows:
*   edu.kent.cs.ntietz.PairsJob
*   edu.kent.cs.ntietz.StripesJob
These then take commandline arguments to set them up for the different parts of the assignment.


HOW TO RUN

To compile my code, run "ant jar". If you do not want to recompile, I have included the appropriate jar file already.
To run problems, run the following from the directory in which "build.xml" is located.

For problem 1, run this (replacing the paths with where the input/output should go):
hadoop jar dist/jobs.jar edu.kent.cs.ntietz.PairsJob line /path/to/input /path/to/output
hadoop jar dist/jobs.jar edu.kent.cs.ntietz.StripesJob line /path/to/input /path/to/output
These run with the pairs and stripes algorithms, respectively.

For problem 2a, run this (replacing the paths with where the input/output should go):
hadoop jar dist/jobs.jar edu.kent.cs.ntietz.PairsJob line /path/to/input /path/to/output
hadoop jar dist/jobs.jar edu.kent.cs.ntietz.StripesJob line /path/to/input /path/to/output
These run with the pairs and stripes algorithms, respectively.

For problem 2b, run this (replacing the paths with where the input/output should go):
hadoop jar dist/jobs.jar edu.kent.cs.ntietz.PairsJob sentence /path/to/input /path/to/output
hadoop jar dist/jobs.jar edu.kent.cs.ntietz.StripesJob sentence /path/to/input /path/to/output
These run with the pairs and stripes algorithms, respectively.

For problem 2c, run this (replacing the paths with where the input/output should go):
hadoop jar dist/jobs.jar edu.kent.cs.ntietz.PairsJob paragraph /path/to/input /path/to/output
hadoop jar dist/jobs.jar edu.kent.cs.ntietz.StripesJob paragraph /path/to/input /path/to/output
These run with the pairs and stripes algorithms, respectively.

For the bonus Enron job, run this (replacing the paths with where the input/output should go):
hadoop jar dist/jobs.jar edu.kent.cs.ntietz.EnronJob /path/to/input /path/to/output
